# CS3012

This repository contains the code related content for CS3012's coursework. 

Note: For the earlier assignments, I was intially going to use Java but opted to learn **Python** instead. The assignments related to the
Github Access have been done through **R**. 

### Lowest Common Ancestor
To implement a function that can calculate the lowest common ancestor in a graph, that may be structured as a binary tree.

Relevant Files: LCA.py, test_lca_unittest.py

### Lowest Common Ancestor 2 
Enhanced the previous LCA solution, implementating it in a way that can work for graphs structured in directed acyclic form.

Relevant Files: DAG.py, test_lca_dag.py

### Github Access
Interrogate the GitHub API to retrieve and display data regarding the logged in developer. This simply prints details about the 
user in the R console, but has been further developed in the following assignment. 

Relevant Files: github_access.R

### Social Graph
Building on the previous assignment to visualise the data.  

Relevant Files: github_interrogation.R
